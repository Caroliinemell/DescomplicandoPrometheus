# [Uncomplicating Prometheus] (https://www.linuxtips.io/products/descomplicando-o-prometheus) - The Training

## The [Uncomplicating Prometheus] Training (https://www.linuxtips.io/products/descomplicando-o-prometheus)

We thought of doing some really practical training. A training where the person can learn the concepts and the whole theory with interesting explanations and excellent didactics, with example and practical challenges so that you can execute all the knowledge acquired. This is very important for you to be able to pin down and further explore the training content.
And finally, let's simulate some conversations, so that it feels a little more like day-to-day life in the workplace.

During the training we will go through all the important topics of Prometheus, so that at the end of the training you have all the knowledge and also all the security to implement and administer Prometheus in critical and complex environments.

Let's understand what Prometheus is and how it can help us monitor our services and systems. We will learn several ways to install and configure Prometheus, always aiming at the best performance and coverage of various scenarios.
We will integrate it with several tools such as Grafana and AlertManager, bringing even more power to Prometheus. 
During the training we will understand how to create performative queries that can bring us the information we need.
We're going to learn a lot about exporters, rules, and alerts.
We believe that the best environment to have Prometheus running safely and in high availability is within Kubernetes clusters, so during training we will be exposed to this scenario very often, after all this training is to prepare you for real life and real environments.
We will learn about using storage to persist collected data and also how to configure Prometheus to benefit from the full dynamism of service discovery.
We will learn about how to configure and use the Push Gateway and, of course, learn how to monitor Prometheus itself.

And of course, always bringing examples of real integrations and use cases to help enrich the training even more.

Are we ready to start our journey?

## The idea of the training format

Teach Prometheus in a more real way, passing on all the content in a practical way and bringing a connection with the real work environment.

This is the first training on Prometheus in a really practical, real life way. Because we understand that practice is the set of understanding about a subject, followed by real examples that can be reproduced and connecting all of this with the way we work.

Thus, the definition of practice becomes one focused on knowledge of the tool and adding the reality of a professional in his day-to-day life learning a new technology, a new tool.

Get ready for a new type of training, and best of all, get ready for a new concept about hands-on training and technology learning.
